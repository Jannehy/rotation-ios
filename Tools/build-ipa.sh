xcodebuild is not usable. If the error above mentions a "command line tools
instance", point the toolchain at Xcode:

    sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
    xcodebuild -version

No Team ID found.

Open the project in Xcode once and pick your team under Signing & Capabilities,
or put it into project.yml as DEVELOPMENT_TEAM so it survives regeneration, or
pass it in:

    TEAM_ID=ABCDE12345 Tools/build-ipa.sh

You will find it at developer.apple.com under Account -> Membership details.
